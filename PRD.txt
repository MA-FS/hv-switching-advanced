# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# HV Switching Program Creator - Critical Issues Resolution

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of three critical solutions to address high-priority issues in the HV Switching Program Creator application that are causing browser crashes, data loss, and poor user experience.

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: HV Switching Program Creator - Critical Stability Improvements
**Version**: 2.0
**Target Release**: 3 weeks from project start
**Project Type**: Bug fixes and stability improvements

## Problem Statement

The HV Switching Program Creator currently suffers from critical stability issues including:
- Browser crashes during extended use
- Data loss due to session timeouts
- Memory leaks causing performance degradation
- Poor error handling leading to application crashes

These issues significantly impact user productivity and data integrity for electrical engineers creating high voltage switching programs.

## Business Objectives

1. **Eliminate Data Loss**: Ensure zero user data loss incidents
2. **Improve Reliability**: Achieve >99% application uptime during user sessions
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Provide clear feedback and recovery options
4. **Increase User Confidence**: Implement robust error handling and session management

## Target Users

- Electrical Engineers
- High Voltage Technicians
- Switching Program Operators
- Engineering Supervisors

## Success Metrics

- Zero browser crashes reported
- Session timeout warnings implemented with 100% coverage
- Memory usage remains stable over 8+ hour sessions
- User data loss incidents eliminated
- User satisfaction score improvement of 40%

## Feature Requirements

### 1. IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Error Boundaries Implementation

**Description**: Implement comprehensive error boundary system to prevent application crashes and provide graceful error recovery.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want the application to recover gracefully from errors without losing my work
- As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong
- As a user, I want the ability to report errors and continue working

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Error boundary component wraps main App component
- Error boundaries wrap all critical sections (form, table, PDF generation)
- Fallback UI displays user-friendly error messages
- Error reporting mechanism captures and logs errors
- Users can retry failed operations without losing data
- Error boundaries provide recovery options (refresh section, reload data)

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create reusable ErrorBoundary React component
- Implement error logging and reporting system
- Add fallback UI components for different error scenarios
- Integrate with existing state management

### 2. IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Memory Management System

**Description**: Implement comprehensive memory management to prevent memory leaks and optimize performance during extended use.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want the application to remain responsive during long work sessions
- As a user, I want undo/redo functionality without performance degradation
- As a user, I want the application to handle large switching programs efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- History operations limited to maximum 50 entries
- Event listeners properly cleaned up in useEffect returns
- Data cloning operations optimized for performance
- Memory usage monitoring and cleanup mechanisms
- Automatic garbage collection triggers for large operations
- Performance metrics tracking and reporting

**Technical Requirements**:
- Implement history size limits with circular buffer
- Add cleanup functions for all event listeners
- Optimize React state updates and data cloning
- Add memory usage monitoring utilities
- Implement automatic cleanup for unused data

### 3. HIGH PRIORITY: Session Management System

**Description**: Implement robust session management with idle detection, timeout warnings, and session restoration capabilities.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to be warned before my session times out
- As a user, I want my work automatically saved before session expiration
- As a user, I want to restore my session if accidentally closed
- As a user, I want configurable session timeout settings

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Idle detection with configurable timeout (default 30 minutes)
- Warning dialogs appear 5 minutes before timeout
- Automatic data saving before session expiration
- Session restoration mechanism for browser refresh/close
- Heartbeat mechanism for active sessions
- User preference settings for timeout duration

**Technical Requirements**:
- Implement idle detection using mouse/keyboard activity
- Create session warning modal components
- Add session storage for restoration data
- Implement heartbeat API for session validation
- Add user preference management for session settings



## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Error Boundaries and Memory Management
- Day 1-2: Design and implement ErrorBoundary component
- Day 3-4: Add error boundaries to critical application sections
- Day 5-7: Implement memory management and history limits

### Week 2: Session Management Implementation
- Day 1-3: Implement idle detection and timeout warnings
- Day 4-5: Add session restoration mechanism
- Day 6-7: Implement heartbeat system and user preferences

### Week 3: Testing and Refinement
- Day 1-3: Comprehensive testing of all features
- Day 4-5: Bug fixes and performance optimization
- Day 6-7: Documentation and deployment preparation

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing React 18.3.1
- Must preserve all existing functionality
- Must work with current localStorage and localforage storage
- Must be backward compatible with existing saved programs

## Dependencies

- React 18.3.1 (existing)
- localforage (existing)
- Bootstrap 3.4.1 (existing)

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- Memory management changes could affect existing functionality
- Session management might conflict with current auto-save

**Medium Risk**:
- Error boundaries could mask underlying issues

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive testing with existing data
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Backup and restore mechanisms for user data

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria met for each feature
- Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed current metrics
- User acceptance testing completed successfully
- Documentation updated for new features
- Deployment scripts and rollback procedures ready
